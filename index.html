<h1>Remnant2 is a Great Game</h1>
  <img src="remnant2Image.jpg" alt="Remnant2 Image">
  <ul>
    <li>The game is Dark Souls with guns, so what is there to dislike?</li>
    <li>There is decent replayability as the campaign encounters and worlds are randomized.</li>
    <li>The skills that each class and the dual class system that they introduced for this sequel are for the most part fun to play with.</li>
  </ul>
